# docker-ce-cis-baseline

InSpec profile to validate the secure configuration of Docker Community Edition, against [CIS'](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) Docker Community Edition Benchmark v1.1.0.

## Getting Started  
It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __winrm__.

__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

The latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

## Tailoring to Your Environment
The following inputs must be configured in an inputs ".yml" file for the profile to run correctly for your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/).

```
- Trusted system user
trusted_user: vagrant

- Number of managable docker containers
managable_container_number: 25

- Docker registry cert path
registry_cert_path: /etc/docker/certs.d

- Directory contain certificate certain Docker registry. cis-docker-benchmark-3.7
registry_name: /etc/docker/certs.d/registry_hostname:port

- Certificate file for a certain Docker registry certificate files. cis-docker-benchmark-3.7 and cis-docker-benchmark-3.8
registry_ca_file: /etc/docker/certs.d/registry_hostname:port/ca.crt

- Docker container user
container_user: vagrant

- Docker container cap add
container_capadd: null

- Authorization plugin
authorization_plugin: authz-broker

- Log driver
log_driver: syslog

- Log Opts
log_opts: /syslog-address/

- App armor profile
app_armor_profile: docker-default

- SElinux profile
selinux_profile: /label\:level\:s0-s0\:c1023/

# Running This Baseline Directly from Github

```
# How to run
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/docker-ce-cis-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz -t winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```

### Different Run Options

  [Full exec options](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/cli/#options-3)

## Running This Baseline from a local Archive copy 

If your runner is not always expected to have direct access to GitHub, use the following steps to create an archive bundle of this baseline and all of its dependent tests:

(Git is required to clone the InSpec profile using the instructions below. Git can be downloaded from the [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) site.)

When the __"runner"__ host uses this profile baseline for the first time, follow these steps: 

```
mkdir profiles
cd profiles
git clone https://github.com/mitre/docker-ce-cis-baseline
inspec archive docker-ce-cis-baseline
inspec exec <name of generated archive> -t winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```
For every successive run, follow these steps to always have the latest version of this baseline:

```
cd docker-ce-cis-baseline
git pull
cd ..
inspec archive docker-ce-cis-baseline --overwrite
inspec exec <name of generated archive> -t winrm://<hostip> --user '<admin-account>' --password=<password> --input-file=<path_to_your_inputs_file/name_of_your_inputs_file.yml> --reporter=cli json:<path_to_your_output_file/name_of_your_output_file.json>
```

## Using Heimdall for Viewing the JSON Results

The JSON results output file can be loaded into __[heimdall-lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)__ for a user-interactive, graphical view of the InSpec results. 

The JSON InSpec results file may also be loaded into a __[full heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall)__, allowing for additional functionality such as to store and compare multiple profile runs.

  desc  "$CATALINA_HOME is the environment variable which holds the path to the
root Tomcat directory. It is important to protect access to this in order to
protect the Tomcat binaries and libraries from unauthorized modification. It is
recommended that the ownership of $CATALINA_HOME be tomcat_admin:tomcat. It is
also recommended that the permission on $CATALINA_HOME prevent read, write, and
execute for the world (o-rwx) and prevent write access to the group (g-w). The
security of processes and data that traverse or depend on Tomcat may become
compromised if the $CATALINA_HOME is not secured. "

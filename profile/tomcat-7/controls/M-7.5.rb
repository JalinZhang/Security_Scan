  desc  "The pattern setting informs Tomcat what information should be logged.
At a minimum, enough information to uniquely identify a request, what was
requested, where the requested originated from, and when the request occurred
should be logged. The following will log the request date and time (%t), the
requested URL (%U), the remote IP address (%a), the local IP address (%A), the
request method (%m), the local port (%p), query string, if present, (%q), and
the HTTP status code of the response (%s). pattern='%t %U %a %A %m %p %q %s‚Äù
The level of logging detail prescribed will assist in identifying correlating
security events or incidents. "

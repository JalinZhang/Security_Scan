  desc  "By default, java.util.logging does not provide the capabilities to
configure per-web application settings, only per VM. In order to overcome this
limitation Tomcat implements JULI as a wrapper for java.util.logging. JULI
provides additional configuration functionality so you can set each web
application with different logging specifications. Establishing per application
logging profiles will help ensure that each applicationâ€™s logging verbosity is
set to an appropriate level in order to provide appropriate information when
needed for security review. "
